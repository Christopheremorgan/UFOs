# UFOs

## Project Overview
Build a web page app for a data journalist that focuses on documented UFOs sightings in the US beyond.  The web page includes a table of known sightings that can be filtered on multiple criteria. The web app was built using Javascript, HTML, and Bootstrap and uses data stored in a Javascript array to build a dynamic table that filters on user input.

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary of Opportunities for Further Development 
One drawback on the site is the layout design where the table and filters can be hidden when first landing on the page.   The user is required to scroll down to get to the table.   An opportunity to improve this is to build a layout where the page summary is in a 'window' on the left side of the page and the filters and table are in a slightly bigger window on the right side of the page.
