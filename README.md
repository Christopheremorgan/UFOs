# UFOs

## Project Overview
Build a web page app for a data journalist that focuses on documented UFOs sightings in the US beyond.  The web page includes a table of known sightings that can be filtered on multiple criteria. The web app was built using Javascript, HTML, and Bootstrap and uses data stored in a Javascript array to build a dynamic table that filters on user input.


## Results
On the landing page there is an explanation of the research and intent of the webpage right below the graphics banner.

To get to the table you must scroll down to the bottom below the purpose statement for the webpage.

Multiple filters can be applied via the filter input boxes to the list.  In the image below we start with applying a 'us' filter for the country of the sighting and a 'triangle' filter for the shape sighted.

We can add filters or remove filters as we go.  In the image below we applied a state filter of 'ca' so only sightings in California are displayed.  This is in addition to the prior image's filter.

Keeping all prior filters, we add one more filter in the city input box of 'el cajon'.  We notice that two sightings were logged on the same day in El Cajon, CA.

## Summary of Opportunities for Further Development 
One drawback on the site is the layout design where the table and filters can be hidden when first landing on the page.   The user is required to scroll down to get to the table.   An opportunity to improve this is to build a layout where the page summary is in a 'window' on the left side of the page and the filters and table are in a slightly bigger window on the right side of the page.

Two recommendations for further development
